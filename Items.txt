Common Items Have one Mod, Rare Items have two, Unique Items Have 3, Ledgendary Items have 4 and Mystic Items have 5 mods (Can have six if use fish on mystic Item)
Common Items can only grab from pool of common mods and Rares can Grab from Common mods and Rare Mods and so on. So Mystic Items can grab from Common mods all the way
To Mystic Mods. For Higher Items Like Mystic It is harder to get Mystic Mods rolled on them then it would say to roll Rare Mods on it. This way you have to kind of grind
For the good stats and don't just get them. everything can be changed if Needed.
