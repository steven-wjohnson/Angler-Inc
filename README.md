# Angler-Inc

A simplified idle/incremental browser game. Generate massive amounts of fish and gold to grow your village and buy upgrades.

This is a simple browser game run written in javascript. The general idea is to generate fish by clicking and by purchasing
fisherman to automatically generate a fixed amount of fish per second. As you generate more fish you can afford to purchase
villagers that passively generate gold. You can use gold to purchase further upgrades that enhance your ability to 
generate fish and gold.
